# Shipping with small bets

I default to small, observable bets when the path ahead is fuzzy. It keeps momentum high and gives teams
space to learn without blowing up scope.

## Start with a skinny slice

Pick the thinnest version that proves value—one persona, one flow, one integration. It is easier to
deploy, reason about, and de-risk.

## Instrument the hypothesis

Before launch, decide which signals confirm the bet is working. Add logging, traces, and a simple
dashboard that the team can check together.

## Make reversal cheap

Feature flags, phased rollouts, and generous observability make it painless to slow down or roll back.
Calm delivery is about optionality, not heroics.
